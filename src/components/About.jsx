        Hi, I’m Solange! I’m a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience building 
        websites that are both functional and easy to use. I enjoy solving problems, 
        writing clean code, and bringing ideas to life through technology. When I’m not coding, 
        I celebrate my wins (like fixing bugs) with a little dance. 
        Let’s create something amazing together!</h1>
